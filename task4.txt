This program implements a simple movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering based on user ratings. It recommends movies to users based on the similarity of their preferences to other users.

Key Features:
User-Movie Matrix:

The input data consists of users and their ratings for various movies.
This data is converted into a user-item matrix, where each row represents a user, each column represents a movie, and the values are the users' ratings for the movies.
Cosine Similarity:

The similarity between users is computed using cosine similarity. This technique measures the similarity of users' rating patterns based on the angle between their rating vectors.
A similarity matrix is created to represent how closely users are related to each other based on their movie preferences.
Movie Recommendations:

The program can recommend movies to a specific user by looking at other users who have similar preferences and checking which movies they have rated highly but the target user has not seen.
It predicts ratings for the unrated movies based on the weighted average of ratings from similar users and suggests the top recommendations.
Workflow:
User-Item Matrix: The raw user-movie ratings are converted into a matrix where each row corresponds to a user, and each column corresponds to a movie. Missing ratings are filled with 0.

Scaling: The ratings are standardized to ensure they are on the same scale, which is important for computing similarity accurately.

User Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity is used to measure how closely two users' rating patterns align. This results in a user-user similarity matrix.

Recommendation Function: The system suggests movies by predicting the ratings of unrated movies for a user based on the ratings given by similar users. The top recommendations are then returned.

Example:
For a user like "Alice," the system looks at other users who have rated movies similarly to her and recommends movies she hasn't watched yet, ranked by predicted rating.

This project introduces collaborative filtering techniques, helping to understand user-based recommendation systems, which are foundational to real-world platforms like Netflix and Amazon.
