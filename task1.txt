This program is a simple rule-based chatbot built using Python. It responds to user inputs by recognizing specific keywords or phrases using if-else statements. When the user interacts with the chatbot, it provides responses based on a set of predefined rules.

Key Features:
Basic Greetings: The chatbot can respond to common greetings like "hello" or "hi" with friendly replies.
Conversation Flow: It handles simple conversation queries such as "how are you?" or "what's your name?" to simulate basic dialogue.
Time Query: If the user asks for the current time, the chatbot will fetch and display the system's current time.
Exit Condition: The chatbot recognizes the word "bye" and ends the conversation gracefully.
Fallback Responses: If the user input doesn't match any predefined rules, the chatbot asks the user to rephrase, indicating it's unable to process the input.
This basic chatbot demonstrates how natural language processing can be implemented with simple rule-based techniques, providing a foundational understanding of conversational flow and input handling
